In this project I created a simple AI model using Teachable Machine.  
The model is trained to classify four different professions, such as:
- Programmer / Developer
- Engineer
- Designer(ui/ux-graphic)
- Doctor

  
After building the model, I tested it using a Python script that allows the user to input an image, and the model tries to predict the profession shown in the image.
